# AFTER NETI NETI: THE SYSTEM MANUAL
*A Logic-Based Refactor of the Human Operating System*

## 0. Initializing
This is an open-source project dedicated to deconstructing the "Caring God" User Interface and accessing the **Kernel of Ṛta** (Universal Order). 

Most philosophical systems fail because they attempt to patch "Legacy Code"—adding layers of theology to explain away an indifferent universe. This manual performs a **Wipe-and-Reinstall**.

## 1. Project Architecture
The manual is organized into three "Books" (Acts):
* **Book I: Stripping God** (The Hardware Disconnect) - *In Progress*
* **Book II: Stripping Religion** (The Social OS) - *Planned*
* **Book III: Stripping the Self** (The Final Deconstruction) - *Planned*

## 2. Current Documentation
* [Chapter 1: The Problem of a Caring God](./Chapter_1_The_Problem_of_a_Caring_God.md) - A derivation of Substrate Necessity and the diagnosis of the "Caring God" Namespace Error.
